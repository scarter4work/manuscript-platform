Chapter 1

The rain hammered against the windshield as Detective Sarah Martinez pulled into the abandoned warehouse district. Three bodies in two weeks, all found in similar locations. All missing their left hands.

"This is getting worse," her partner Jake muttered from the passenger seat. He was right. The killer was accelerating.

Sarah killed the engine and checked her weapon. The warehouse ahead looked empty, but the anonymous tip had been specific. Building 7, third floor. Come alone.

She wasn't alone, of course. Jake had her back, and backup was two minutes out. But she'd parked around the corner, out of sight.

"I don't like this," Jake said. "It's too obvious. He wants you here."

"Then let's not disappoint him."

Sarah pushed open the car door and stepped into the rain. The industrial complex stretched out before her, a maze of corrugated metal and broken windows. Building 7 loomed ahead, darker than the rest.

Her phone buzzed. Unknown number.

"Come up the north stairwell. Alone. Or the next body will be someone you know."

Sarah's blood ran cold. He was watching. She scanned the windows but saw nothing. Just darkness and rain.

"Change of plans," she said into her radio. "I'm going in. Visual confirmation only. Do not engage until I signal."

Jake grabbed her arm. "Sarah, this is suicide."

"It's also our only lead." She pulled free and started toward the building.

The north stairwell stank of mold and rust. Sarah took the steps two at a time, her flashlight cutting through the darkness. At the third floor landing, she paused. A door stood slightly ajar, yellow light spilling through the crack.

She pushed it open with her foot, weapon raised.

The room was empty except for a metal chair in the center. On the chair sat a laptop, screen glowing. Sarah approached cautiously, checking corners, watching shadows.

On the screen, a video played. A figure in shadows, voice distorted.

"Detective Martinez. We finally meet."

"Show yourself," Sarah demanded, still sweeping the room.

"All in good time. First, let me tell you about the hands."

Sarah's finger tensed on the trigger. Where was he?

"Each victim was guilty of a crime they thought they'd gotten away with. Each hand they used to hurt someone innocent. I'm just evening the scales."

"You're a murderer," Sarah said. "Nothing more."

"Am I? Tell me, Detective, how many cases have you closed where you knew the perpetrator but couldn't prove it? How many times have you watched guilty people walk free?"

Sarah said nothing. The answer was too many.

"I thought so. We're not so different, you and I."

"We're nothing alike."

"No? Then why are you here alone, against orders? Why didn't you call for backup before entering? Because you wanted to end this yourself. Because sometimes the law isn't enough."

A sound behind her. Sarah spun, but too late. Something struck her head and the world went dark.

---

When Sarah woke, she was zip-tied to the metal chair. The laptop was gone. Her weapon was gone. And her left hand was exposed, palm up on the armrest.

A figure emerged from the shadows. Tall, wearing a black hood. In his gloved hand, a surgical saw.

"Nothing personal, Detective. But you've been covering for your partner for months. Those evidence tampering charges? The witness intimidation? That was Jake, not the suspects."

Sarah's heart stopped. "You're lying."

"Am I? Check your phone. I've sent you the proof. Jake's been playing both sides for years."

The figure moved closer, the saw whirring to life.

"I'm giving you a choice, Detective. Your hand, or your integrity. Admit the truth, expose your partner, and I'll let you go. Stay silent, and you'll join the others."

Sarah's mind raced. Jake had been acting strange. Those late nights, the unexplained cash. But he'd saved her life twice. He was her partner.

The saw touched her wrist.

"Ten seconds, Detective. What's it going to be?"
