# Phase 2 Status: Router Infrastructure

## Completed ‚úÖ

### 1. Middleware Files Created
- **middleware/cors.js** - CORS and security headers handling
- **middleware/auth.js** - Authentication middleware with user attachment
- **middleware/rateLimit.js** - Rate limiting integration
- **middleware/errorHandling.js** - Global error handler
- **middleware/index.js** - Combined middleware function

### 2. Route Files Created
- **routes/auth.js** - All 8 authentication routes registered

### 3. Entry Point Created
- **worker-router.js** - New itty-router-based entry point
- **wrangler.router.toml** - Test configuration

## Issue Discovered üêõ

**Problem**: Middleware causing request hangs with itty-router v4

**Symptoms**:
- All requests timeout with "Worker code hung" error
- Occurs even with minimal test router
- Issue is in middleware execution pattern

**Root Cause**: Need to investigate itty-router v4 middleware pattern
- May need different middleware chaining approach
- Possible async/await handling issue
- Router.handle() might need different setup

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix itty-router Integration
1. Research itty-router v4 middleware patterns
2. Test with official examples
3. Fix middleware execution
4. Complete Phase 2 testing

### Option 2: Alternative Approach
1. Use different router library (Hono, Worktop)
2. Or implement custom routing with better middleware control
3. Maintain same modular structure

## Files Ready for Phase 3

Once router is working, these are ready:
- ‚úÖ All middleware (cors, auth, rateLimit, errorHandling)
- ‚úÖ Auth routes (8 routes)
- ‚è≥ Manuscript routes (TODO)
- ‚è≥ Payment routes (TODO)
- ‚è≥ Admin routes (TODO)
- ‚è≥ Analysis routes (TODO)
- ‚è≥ Asset routes (TODO)
- ‚è≥ DMCA routes (TODO)
- ‚è≥ Results routes (TODO)

## Architecture Benefits (Once Working)

1. **Modular** - Each route group in separate file
2. **Testable** - Middleware can be unit tested
3. **Maintainable** - Easy to find and modify routes
4. **Type-safe** - Clear middleware contracts
5. **DRY** - Shared middleware reduces duplication

## Current Production Status

- Production still uses worker.js (unaffected)
- Phase 2 work is in parallel development
- Can roll back or try alternative router
- No production impact from Phase 2 work
