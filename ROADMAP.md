## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Amazon API Limitations
- **Mitigation**: Use web scraping as backup, or semi-automated approach

### Risk 2: Users Don't Want Full Automation
- **Mitigation**: Build in phases, validate each step with real users

### Risk 3: AI-Generated Content Quality
- **Mitigation**: Always provide human review/edit before publishing

### Risk 4: KDP Terms of Service
- **Mitigation**: Review TOS carefully, may need author's explicit KDP credentials

### Risk 5: Market Saturation
- **Mitigation**: Focus on unique value prop (speed + automation), not just AI

6. Do they want sales tracking built in?
7. What's most valuable: speed, quality, or cost savings?
