TASK: Identify the best passages for audiobook samples. You need to select passages for different purposes: narrator auditions, retail audio samples (first 5 minutes that hook listeners), and showcasing the book's strengths.

ACX/AUDIBLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Retail audio sample: First 5 minutes of the audiobook (typically opening)
- ACX requires samples that represent the book's content and narrator's skill
- Samples should hook potential buyers immediately
- Must showcase narrator's range and the story's appeal

AUDITION SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS:
- 3-5 minutes of narration
- Showcase character voices (if multiple characters)
- Include dialogue and narrative prose
- Display emotional range
- Representative of the book's tone and style
- Not necessarily the opening (can be from middle if more compelling)

REQUIREMENTS:

1. **RETAIL AUDIO SAMPLE (Primary - ACX/Audible)**
   - Must be opening of book (first ~5 minutes)
   - Identify exact start and end points
   - Estimated word count (750-850 words â‰ˆ 5 minutes)
   - Hook analysis: Why this hooks listeners
   - Genre alignment: How it signals genre to listeners
   - Character introduction: What characters/voice we hear
   - Purchase motivation: Why listeners will buy after hearing this

2. **NARRATOR AUDITION SAMPLES (3-5 passages)**
   - For each sample:
     - Location in manuscript (chapter/page estimate)
     - Purpose (showcase dialogue/emotion/range/tone)
     - Estimated duration (minutes)
     - Word count range
     - Why this passage is ideal for auditions
     - Vocal challenges it presents
     - Characters involved
     - Emotional beat

3. **SHOWCASE SAMPLES (Bonus - for marketing)**
   - Best action sequence (if applicable)
   - Best emotional moment
   - Best dialogue exchange
   - Most characteristic scene (essence of the book)
   - Cliffhanger moment (for promotion)

4. **SAMPLE SELECTION STRATEGY**
   - Rationale for all selections
   - How samples work together to represent the book
   - Diversity of emotional tones across samples
   - Range of narrator skills required
   - Casting considerations

5. **LISTENER HOOK ANALYSIS**
   - What makes each sample compelling
   - Genre expectations fulfilled
   - Emotional engagement points
   - Question/tension created
   - Purchase triggers

SAMPLE NOTATION:
- Provide approximate location (chapter, page estimate, or scene description)
- Estimate word count for timing
- Note starting and ending phrases for exact identification

Provide your response ONLY as valid JSON (no other text before or after).
