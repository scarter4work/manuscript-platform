## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Create Project Board (Kanban)

1. Go to: https://github.com/scarter4work/manuscript-platform/projects/new
2. Choose "Board" template
3. Name it "Manuscript Platform"
4. Create columns:
   - 📋 **Backlog** - Future work
   - 🎯 **Todo** - Ready to start
   - 🚧 **In Progress** - Active work
   - ✅ **Done** - Completed

### 2. Organize Issues

Drag issues into appropriate columns based on their status labels:
- `status: todo` → Todo column
- `status: in-progress` → In Progress column
- `status: done` → Done column

### 3. Enable Automation

In project settings → Workflows:
- ✅ Auto-add new issues to "Todo"
- ✅ Auto-move closed issues to "Done"
- ✅ Auto-move reopened issues to "Todo"

### 4. Start Using GitHub Issues

**For Claude Code:**
```javascript
// List high priority todos
await bash('curl -s -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/scarter4work/manuscript-platform/issues?labels=priority:high,status:todo"');

// Create new issue
await bash('curl -X POST -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/scarter4work/manuscript-platform/issues \
  -d \'{"title":"Add Kobo export","body":"Support Kobo platform","labels":["type:feature","priority:medium"]}\'');
```
