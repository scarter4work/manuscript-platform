## How It Works

### Analysis Flow

## Amazon KDP Optimization

### Pricing Considerations

**Ebook Pricing**:
- $0.99 - $2.99: Maximum visibility (70% royalty with KDP Select)
- $2.99 - $9.99: Standard range (70% royalty)
- $9.99+: Premium pricing (35% royalty)

**Paperback Pricing**:
- Based on: Page count, trim size, color/B&W
- Amazon printing costs: ~$2.50-$5.00
- Recommended markup: 2.5x-3x printing cost
- Typical range: $9.99-$19.99

### Category Strategy

**Amazon allows up to 10 categories**:
- 2-3 primary (highly relevant)
- 3-4 secondary (broader reach)
- 3-4 niche (bestseller potential)

**BISAC Code Examples**:
- FIC031000: FICTION / Thrillers / General
- FIC030000: FICTION / Thrillers / Suspense
- FIC031010: FICTION / Thrillers / Psychological

### Keyword Strategy

**7 Keyword Phrases** (up to 50 characters each):
- High-intent phrases (buyers, not browsers)
- Genre-specific terms
- Mood/tone descriptors
- Comparable author associations
- Unique plot elements

**Example Keywords**:
- "psychological thriller suspense"
- "domestic thriller women"
- "twisty mystery unreliable narrator"
