            <p>Before filing a DMCA notice, ensure you have a valid copyright claim and that the material is actually infringing.</p>

            <h2>7. User Copyright Attestation</h2>

            <p>When uploading a manuscript, all users must check the following attestation:</p>

            <div class="notice-box">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><em>"I certify that I am the copyright owner of this manuscript, or I have obtained all necessary permissions to upload and analyze this work. I understand that uploading copyrighted material without permission is illegal and may result in account termination and legal action."</em></p>
            </div>

            <p>By checking this box, you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Certify that you have legal rights to the uploaded content</li>
                <li>Accept full legal responsibility for copyright infringement claims</li>
                <li>Agree to indemnify us against any copyright claims related to your uploads</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. AI-Generated Content and Copyright</h2>

            <h3>8.1 User Ownership</h3>
            <p>All AI-generated content created by our Service for your manuscripts (editing feedback, marketing materials, cover designs) belongs to you. You have full commercial rights to use this content.</p>

            <h3>8.2 Third-Party Content</h3>
            <p>If you upload manuscripts containing third-party content (quotes, lyrics, images), you are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Obtaining necessary permissions or licenses</li>
                <li>Ensuring fair use compliance</li>
                <li>Indemnifying us against copyright claims</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. Fair Use Considerations</h2>

            <p>Not all uses of copyrighted material constitute infringement. Fair use may apply in cases of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Criticism and commentary</li>
                <li>News reporting</li>
                <li>Teaching and scholarship</li>
                <li>Research</li>
                <li>Parody</li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis and depends on factors like purpose, amount used, and market impact. When in doubt, seek legal advice or obtain permission.</p>

            <h2>10. International Copyright</h2>

            <p>We comply with international copyright treaties, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Berne Convention</li>
                <li>WIPO Copyright Treaty</li>
                <li>Universal Copyright Convention</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you are located outside the United States and believe your copyright has been infringed, you may file a DMCA notice using the same process outlined above.</p>
