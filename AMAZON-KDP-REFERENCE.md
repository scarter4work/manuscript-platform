## Amazon's Algorithm (A9)

### Factors That Affect Visibility
1. **Sales velocity** (sales per day)
2. **Conversion rate** (page views → purchases)
3. **Keywords** (title, subtitle, keywords, categories)
4. **Reviews** (quantity and quality)
5. **Page reads** (if in KDP Select)
6. **Price** (lower prices may rank better initially)
7. **Also-boughts** (who buys your book also buys...)

### How to Rank
1. Launch with momentum (pre-orders, email list)
2. Optimize keywords and categories
3. Get reviews (legitimately)
4. Run promotions
5. Keep sales consistent
6. Encourage page reads (KDP Select)

---

## Book Launch Strategy

### Pre-Launch (4-8 weeks)
1. Set up pre-order
2. Build email list
3. Engage on social media
4. Reach out to ARC readers (Advance Review Copy)
5. Prepare marketing materials

### Launch Week (Day 1-7)
1. Email list announcement
2. Social media posts
3. Price promotion ($0.99 or free if in Select)
4. ARC readers post reviews
5. Monitor rankings

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Bad cover design** - Most common reason for poor sales
2. **Poor book description** - Second most common
3. **Wrong categories** - Makes book undiscoverable
4. **Generic keywords** - Too competitive
5. **Pricing too high** - Especially for debut authors
6. **No editing** - Damages reputation
7. **Neglecting metadata** - Title, subtitle, description all matter
8. **Ignoring marketing** - Publishing isn't enough
9. **Expecting overnight success** - Takes time to build audience
10. **Not writing the next book** - Series sell better than standalones

## KDP API & Automation

### Bad News
Amazon shut down their public KDP API in 2019. There is no official way to programmatically publish books.

### Options for Automation

#### Option 1: Browser Automation
Use Puppeteer or Playwright to:
1. Log into KDP
2. Fill out forms
3. Upload files
4. Submit for publishing

**Pros**: Works exactly like a human
**Cons**: Fragile (breaks if Amazon changes UI), may violate TOS

#### Option 2: Semi-Automated
Generate all files and metadata, then:
1. Provide downloadable package
2. Show step-by-step instructions
3. User manually uploads to KDP

**Pros**: No TOS concerns, reliable
**Cons**: Not fully automated

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
Pre-fill forms using browser extension or bookmarklet:
1. Generate all data
2. User opens KDP
3. Tool auto-fills forms
4. User reviews and submits

**Pros**: User maintains control, faster than manual
**Cons**: Still requires user action
